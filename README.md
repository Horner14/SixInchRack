The project is a scaled down version of the familiar 19" rack standard, with the following size:
 - 1U is 14mm
 - The front plate is 15.5cm wide
 - The inside distance between the two vertical profiles is 11.5cm
 
It is designed for the 20x20 extruded aluminium profile, but a profile can also be printed.
